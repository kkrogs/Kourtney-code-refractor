Title: Horeison Marketing Agency


Description:

The purpose of this project is to create an accessible website for people with disabilities. Using the alt="" attributes, software for people with visual imparement or other disabilities will describe what my website looks like. This will help the client's marketing agency to reach a broader audience and upheld accessibility standards.


How to use:

The links in the upper right hand corner will eventually take the user to pages about search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. Scrolling down, you will get headers and adjectives about what each term means and how it will help your business. If a customer with a visual impairment wants to know what the images look like, their software should be able to read images, text, and more for them.

As a result, this will increase usability and promote an inclusive enviornment.
